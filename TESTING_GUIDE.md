# FreshToday - Testing Guide

## 🎯 Current Issue
The app doesn't navigate past the login screen after signing in on your real phone.

## 📱 New Debug Version
I've added a debug button to the login screen to help diagnose the issue.

## 🚀 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Install the New Version
1. **Upload the new AAB** to Google Play Console: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
2. **Wait for Google Play to process** the update (usually 1-2 hours)
3. **Update the app** on your phone from Google Play Store

### Step 2: Test the App
1. **Open the FreshToday app** on your phone
2. **You should see the login screen**
3. **Tap the "🔍 Debug Info" button** at the bottom
4. **Check the debug information** that appears

### Step 3: What to Look For
The debug dialog will show:

**AuthProvider State:**
- `isLoading`: Should be false initially
- `isAuthenticated`: Should be false initially  
- `user`: Should be null initially
- `error`: Should be null initially

**Firebase State:**
- `currentUser`: Should be null initially
- `email`: Should be null initially
- `displayName`: Should be null initially

### Step 4: Test Login
1. **Try logging in** with your credentials
2. **After login attempt, tap "🔍 Debug Info" again**
3. **Check what changed** in the debug information

## 🔍 Expected Behavior

### Before Login:
- AuthProvider: `isAuthenticated: false`, `user: null`
- Firebase: `currentUser: null`

### After Successful Login:
- AuthProvider: `isAuthenticated: true`, `user: [username]`
- Firebase: `currentUser: [user_id]`, `email: [email]`

## 🚨 Common Issues to Check

### 1. Firebase Configuration
- **Check if Firebase is properly configured** for your phone
- **Verify the SHA-1 fingerprint** is added to Firebase Console
- **Ensure Authentication providers** are enabled

### 2. Network Issues
- **Check internet connection** on your phone
- **Try on WiFi vs mobile data**

### 3. Google Play Services
- **Ensure Google Play Services** is up to date
- **Check if Google Sign-In** works

## 📋 What to Report Back

Please tell me:

1. **What you see in the debug info** before and after login
2. **Any error messages** that appear
3. **Whether the app stays on login screen** after login attempt
4. **If Google Sign-In works** or fails
5. **Any specific error messages** in the debug info

## 🔧 Next Steps

Based on what you find in the debug info, we can:
- **Fix Firebase configuration** if needed
- **Update authentication logic** if there are issues
- **Add more debugging** if the problem persists

**The debug button will help us pinpoint exactly where the authentication flow is breaking!** 🎯
